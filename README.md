# 🌍 Google-Cloud-Platform (GCP) Learning Journey

Welcome to my **GCP Learning Journey** repository 🚀

This is where I document my exploration of **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and fundamental **cloud computing concepts**. The aim is to create a structured collection of:

- 📑 Notes & documentation on GCP services
- 💻 Practical code snippets and experiments
- 🛠️ Hands-on challenges and walkthroughs
- 📚 Best practices and references for cloud development

It’s a work-in-progress resource, designed both as my personal study log and (hopefully) a useful reference for others starting their own cloud journey.

## 📖 About

Cloud computing is becoming essential for modern development, and this repository is my way of learning by **building, documenting, and experimenting** with GCP.

Expect to find (as I build it out):

- Explanations of services like **Cloud Functions**, **Cloud Storage**, **Pub/Sub**, etc.
- Code challenges (e.g. uploading files programmatically to a storage bucket)
- Notes on architecture, security, and cost optimisation
- Walkthroughs of small proof-of-concept projects
